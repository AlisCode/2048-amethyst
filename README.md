# 2048-Amethyst

2048-amethyst is a Rust implementation of the famous game [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)) using the [Amethyst game engine](https://amethyst.rs).

The blog post [this week in Amethyst #16](https://amethyst.rs/blog/twia-16/) mentionned that dogfooding is a good practice for a game engine. This project is meant to be a demonstration of how simple and elegant it is to implement such a simple application with Amethyst.
